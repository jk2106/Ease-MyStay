# Ease-MyStay
Brief description: A platform where owner of a hotel or hotel chain can post their properties so 
that users can select a hotel of their desired choice for a stay for any number of days of their 
wish. 
Problem statement: Online room(s) booking in a chain of hotels would facilitate the existing 
customers, as well as potential new customers, in booking rooms and itinerary prior to their 
arrival. This would not only enable them to be more comfortable (because they would know 
that the hotel room of their choice is already booked) but also increase the chances of 
maximizing hotel room bookings and minimizing the load on front desk receptions of any hotels. 
Design an application to simplify the process of hotel room booking. 
Core problem: Users donâ€™t have an advanced hotel booking/reservation system which can bring 
hassle free booking experience and provide assurance for a comfortable stay.
